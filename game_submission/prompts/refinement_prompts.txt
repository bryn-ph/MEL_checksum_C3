prompt2: Visual polish: add small icons/badges to the result banner; subtle particle/confetti for big wins.
prompt3: improve the ui. I want menu screen, and then a game screen. I want there to better ui options on the game screen, i want icons, i want nicer background colours, the time remaining to have a status bar. more indication as to what happens from indecisiveness for options.
prompt4: when playing the game keeps freezing. Getting this error app.js:145 Uncaught SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'add' on 'DOMTokenList': The token provided must not be empty.

prompt7: separate the javascript code into separate files for better practises.
