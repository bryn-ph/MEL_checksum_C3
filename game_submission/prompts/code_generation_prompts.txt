Its got to be very interactive and engaging.  I want it to cover the struggles of getting a job, a house, paying bills on time, and random life problems that come up to do with money in the economy like stock crashes rent rising and new taxes.

prompt6: Lets create a json/multiple json files that contains all the different life decisions and events that could happen i want there to be  50+ events due to getting a job and housing expenses and random events that could happen.
prompt7: now integrate these into game the game logic have the random events randomly occur.
prompt8: addd more events into the json store the specific time, if there is a timelimit for the decision. also group the decisions based on order in which they should or could occur eg have different pools of responses based on how many questions have been asked before the current question keeping in mind the game should go on from between 5 to 35 questions. retrieve the questions from the data files also make the stock stuff make sense you should have counters that can appear for each different event that might require a new counter eg if you get stock related questions first you would have had to have a question related to putting money into stocks.

I also want the screen to flash green or red if something lucky or unlucky happens. I want there to be some realism and funny events with funny comments.
prompt13: include events like having to pay rent and then having the option to wait and not pay it which increases the bills and expenses in the future
