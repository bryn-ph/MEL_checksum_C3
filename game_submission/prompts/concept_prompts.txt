Prompt1: You are helping design a simple 2D web-based game for a student project challenge. The goal is to vibe code (collaboratively build using AI tools) a complete game that highlights and addresses a pressing social challenge in Australia or Vietnam. Please brainstorm multiple game ideas that are: Easy to build and achievable using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a simple framework like React or Phaser). In a board, card, or dice game format.

Finally, rank the ideas by simplicity and educational impact, recommending the best one for rapid prototyping. Focus on simplicity, clarity, and feasibility — the goal is a small but complete, educational 2D web game that can be built quickly with LLM assistance.
Prompt2: I want to make a javascript/html/css game in the form of a board game, card game or dice game that talks about mental health or the housing crises. Please give me 5 to 10 ideas.
Prompt3: I want a game that talks about the housing crises in the form of a card game please give me ideas that will consider the different effects of actions on the housing market or money flowing in the economy.
