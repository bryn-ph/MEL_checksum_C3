You are helping design a simple 2D web-based game for a student project challenge. The goal is to vibe code (collaboratively build using AI tools) a complete game that highlights and addresses a pressing social challenge in Australia or Vietnam. Please brainstorm multiple game ideas that are: Easy to build and achievable using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a simple framework like React or Phaser). In a board, card, or dice game format. Fun, educational, and impactful, giving players a meaningful perspective on a real-world issue. Mechanically linked to the social issue (not just thematically). Suggested social issue themes include (but are not limited to): Climate change & sustainability Access to education Mental health & wellbeing Social equity & inclusion Community resilience Requirements for your answer: Provide 5–8 distinct game concepts, each with: A title The social issue it addresses The core gameplay mechanics (e.g., dice roll, tile movement, event cards) A short description of how the gameplay connects to the issue A note on why it’s easy to implement with simple web technologies. Finally, rank the ideas by simplicity and educational impact, recommending the best one for rapid prototyping. Focus on simplicity, clarity, and feasibility — the goal is a small but complete, educational 2D web game that can be built quickly with LLM assistance.
