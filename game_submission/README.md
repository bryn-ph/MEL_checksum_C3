# 🏠 House of Cards: The Housing Crisis

A 2–6 player satirical card game about surviving Australia’s housing market.

## 🎴 Components
- 18 Property Cards — Buy, rent, or risk foreclosure  
- 20 Event Cards — Random life events that shake the market  
- 12 Action Cards — Strategic plays (Sell, Swap, Sue, etc.)  
- 10 Crisis Cards — Trigger global market effects every few rounds  
- Money Tokens / Digital Counter — Tracks cash and debt  
- Player Reference Sheet (optional) — Summarizes turn order & icons

## 🧩 Setup
1. Shuffle all Property, Event, and Action cards into one Main Deck.  
2. Shuffle the Crisis Deck separately.  
3. Each player starts with:
   - 💰 $2,000 cash  
   - 🏚️ No properties  
   - 💳 Debt limit: $3,000 (you can’t owe more than this)  
4. Draw 3 cards from the Main Deck.  
5. Determine the starting player (youngest goes first or roll a die).

## 🔁 Turn Structure
Each turn follows these phases:

1. **Draw Phase**
   - Draw 1 card from the Main Deck.  
   - Maximum hand size = 5 cards (discard extras immediately).

2. **Play Phase**
   - You may play up to 2 cards:
     - Property Card: Pay its price to buy it.  
     - Event Card: Apply the effect instantly.  
     - Action Card: Apply as described (e.g., “Swap a property,” “Force another player to pay rent”).  
   - You may also take a loan during your turn (see "Loan Rules").

3. **Resolve Phase**
   - Resolve ongoing effects or triggered abilities (e.g., “double rent this turn”).

4. **Income Phase**
   - Collect base rent from each owned property.  
   - Example: Own “Sydney Apartment” (Rent $200) and “Regional House” (Rent $100) → gain $300.

5. **End Phase**
   - Discard down to 5 cards.  
   - Pass the turn clockwise.

## 💣 Market & Crisis Phase
- Every 3 full rounds, draw a Crisis Card and apply it to all players.  
- Example Crisis effects:
  - 🧨 **Interest Rates Surge** — Each player pays $200 × number of properties.  
  - 🌊 **Floods Hit the Coast** — High-risk properties lose rent for 2 rounds.  
- After resolving a Crisis Card, discard it and continue play.

## 💳 Loan Rules
- Players can borrow up to $3,000 total at any time.  
- Loans must be repaid with +10% interest before the game ends.  
- If you cannot pay, your highest-value property is repossessed.  
- Example: Borrow $1,000 → owe $1,100 later. If you end the game with only $500 → lose your top property.

## 🏁 Win / Lose Conditions

### 🏆 Winning
- The game ends after 10 rounds or when the Crisis Deck runs out.  
- The player with the highest Net Worth (cash + property value − debt) wins.

### 💀 Losing
- A player goes bankrupt if they cannot pay rent, debt, or event costs.  
- Bankrupt players sell all properties at half value and are eliminated.

## 🧮 Example Turn
Player A starts with $2,000 and owns “Melbourne Flat (Rent $150)”.

1. **Draw:** Pulls an Event card — “Rent Hike!”  
2. **Play:** Plays “Rent Hike” (+$50 rent to all properties this round).  
3. **Buy:** Purchases “Hobart Unit” for $800. Remaining cash: $1,200.  
4. **Collect Rent:** $150 + $100 + $50 bonus = $300 total.  
5. **End Turn:** Now has $1,500. Passes to next player.

- Q: What if I can’t pay a cost?  
  A: You may take a loan or sell a property. If still unable, you go bankrupt.
